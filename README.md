# Installation
This is how you install it, thanks  [Colek38](https://www.reddit.com/user/Colek38/)  for the files!
- Download this:  [steamui.zip](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/csgo_steamui_websrc_all.zip.8af5e297faf24667a734d24612abc35f7f54576c)

- Open that zip and extract the folder steamui (as it is!) in the root directory of your steam installation (where steam.exe is) >  [https://i.imgur.com/BwYAsZ4.png](https://i.imgur.com/BwYAsZ4.png)

- Create shortcut of said steam.exe

- Edit the shortcut by appending -newlib to it. Look at this >  [https://i.imgur.com/meJc1AX.png](https://i.imgur.com/meJc1AX.png)

- Exit Steam (don't restart, press Exit)

- Open steam with that new shortcut

- Profit?
